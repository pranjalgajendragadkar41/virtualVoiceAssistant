# Virtual Voice Assistant for Desktop

## Internship (In-House) Project

### Duration: 2 months (01/06/2021 – 31/07/2021)

### Role: Team Leader of 3.

### Technology: NLP and AI Algorithms.

### Platform: PyCharm

### Software required:- Python 3.6.8

#### Project Goal: To design a virtual voice assistant for desktop that can make use of Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence to perform day-to-day activity easily.

A virtual assistant, also called an AI assistant or digital assistant, is an application program that understands natural language voice 
commands and completes tasks for the user.

Our virtual assistant will able to do the followings things 

● Greets you at the start,latest weather forecasting information, Launch Games, Launch Windows Applications, Open Websites like Gmail, 
Google Classroom, 
show videos from YouTube, tells you about almost everything you ask, tells you date and time,  news,
fetch data from Wikipedia

● You can interact with your laptop’s microphone/console. The response generated by
the assistant will display on the console and as a speech via the speaker.



>**As a team leader, gathered opinion/suggestions to get the best possible outcome and planned the tasks for the project.** 

>**I was responsible for:** 
> 1. Research
> 2. Artificial Intelligence part
> 3. Python coding for Natural Language Processing
> 4. Report generation
> 5. Making Powerpoint Presentation.
